## Description

- As described in our [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/6/1673), the data used for our analyses comprised a total of 100 CT scans of the bladder, each from a patient with bladder cancer.

- Disease: urothelial carcinoma of the bladder

- Stages: Ta, Tis, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4

- Stage annotation technique: Performed manually by radiologists

For more details, interested readers are directed to the **Dataset** section of the [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/6/1673).

## Availability

Data will be made available under reasonable request to the corresponding author, <a href="mailto:suryadipto.sarkar@fau.de">Suryadipto Sarkar</a> (more contact details below).

# Data preprocessing

## Otsu's thresholding

<br/>

## Overall ROI bounding box selection

Done using hyperparameter that takes as input the choice of the user, as follows:

- Mode 1: Circum-rectangle

- Mode 2: Inner rectangle derived using elipse

- Mode 3 (default): In-rectangle

## Smaller ROI bounding box selection from healthy tissue

Smaller ROI bounding box selection is done using a sliding window implementation, from healthy areas of the tissue, features extracted from which are subsequently used as the initial population for the genetic algorithm.

Note that the feature extracted from the cancer ROI of the same image is subsequently used as the target (also known as, goal) for the genetic algorithm.

Reported results have used initial population size as {10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000}. Reported results have also healthy areas with constant size across the image samples, although this was not really necessary since we are using GLCM texture features from the ROIs and not the ROIs themselves as input to the genetic algorithm.

<!------------------>

# Feature extraction

The following five GLCM features were extracted from the cancer ROI, as well as healthy ROIs from the same patient:

- Dissimilarity
- Correlation
- Energy
- Contrast
- Homogeneity,

using $20$ configurations ($4$ angles $=\{0, \frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{4} \}$; $5$ distances $=\{1, 2, 3,5, 7\}$ pixels).

# Installation

Install conda environment as follows (there also exists a requirements.txt)
```bash
conda create --name imaging_heterogeneity_study
conda activate imaging_heterogeneity_study
pip install scipy==1.10.1 numpy==1.23.5 squidpy==1.3.0 pandas==1.5.3 scikit-learn==1.2.2
```
*Note:* Additionally, modules *math* and *statistics* were used, however no installation is required as they are provided with Python by default.
