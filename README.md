# About

This is a repository that contains information on how to reproduce results corresponding to the *bladder cancer* case study reported in [Paper title](https://paper-doi-when-available).

# Data

![fig2-bladder-paper](fig2-bladder-paper.png)

## Description

- As described in our [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/6/1673), the data used for our analyses comprised a total of 100 CT scans of the bladder, each from a patient with bladder cancer.

- Disease: urothelial carcinoma of the bladder

- Stages: Ta, Tis, T0, T1, T2, T3, T4

- Stage annotation technique: Performed manually by radiologists

For more details, interested readers are directed to the **Dataset** section of the [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/6/1673).

## Availability

Data will be made available under reasonable request to the corresponding author, <a href="mailto:suryadipto.sarkar@fau.de">Suryadipto Sarkar</a> (more contact details below).

# Data preprocessing

## Otsu's thresholding

![github-otsus-thresholding](github-otsus-thresholding.jpg)


## Overall ROI bounding box selection

Done using hyperparameter that takes as input the choice of the user, as follows:

- Mode 1: Circum-rectangle

- Mode 2: Inner rectangle derived using elipse

- Mode 3 (default): In-rectangle

# Installation

Install conda environment as follows (there also exists a requirements.txt)
```bash
conda create --name imaging_heterogeneity_study
conda activate imaging_heterogeneity_study
